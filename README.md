Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot employs advanced NLP models to comprehend user messages accurately, extracting intents and entities to determine user needs.
Contextual Understanding: It maintains context across conversations, allowing for more coherent and relevant responses over multiple interactions.
Multi-turn Dialogue Handling: Capable of handling multi-turn conversations, the chatbot can remember previous interactions to provide contextually appropriate responses.
Integration with External Services: Integration with external APIs enables the chatbot to perform tasks such as retrieving information from databases, making reservations, or accessing third-party services.
Personalization: Through user profiling and learning mechanisms, the chatbot can adapt its responses to individual preferences and behaviors, providing a personalized user experience.
Feedback Mechanism: Incorporating a feedback loop allows users to provide input on the chatbot's performance, enabling continuous improvement and refinement.
Scalability and Deployment: The chatbot is designed to be scalable, allowing for deployment across various platforms, including websites, messaging apps, and voice interfaces.
